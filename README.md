I decided to write this little app when I had a flu and couldn't buy groceries on my own.

It helps me to create a shopping list which can be send via email to a friend (using my default email client).
I can change position of added items thanks to 'drag and drop' feature. It is not finished yet but the most important part is already working.

You can check how it works here: https://paulinawanda.github.io/ShoppingList/
